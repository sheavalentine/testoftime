# Test of Time
A 4x Strategy Game

# Concept
The goal of the game is to have a civilization achieve a Type 1 civilization.  This game differs from many other 4x games in that conquest or other goals aren't inherently beneficial.  A unified civ can achieve type 1 just as easily as one that has dominated the world.

## Loss Conditiosn
 - Famine
 - Disease
 - War
 - Societal Collapse

 - Fusion Power (Far future tech)

## Features
 - Irregual Tiles on a spherical world
 - Tech Tree where tech can be pushed further, or existing tech upgraded.  Tech is discovered probabilitstically.
 - Dynamic effect from policies, policies are many, varied, and important.
 - Demographics reflected from policies
 - Control affects how quickly and easily policies can be made

 - Culture and communication are important

## Game Mechanics
 - Communication technologies increase culture spread
 - Control affects your citizens willingness to do your bidding
 - Happiness affects your citizens productivity
 - Birth Rate affects population growth
 - Money is spent to build things, but that still requires production, forced labor reduces 'growth' production (capitalization)
 - Military Units must be made, and removed from the population, and paid for.
